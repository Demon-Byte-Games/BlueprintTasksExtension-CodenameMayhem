/**
* TaskGraph's is a simple concept where a portion of the game is
* wrapped up into one or several blueprints.
* For example; the tutorial could be wrapped into a blueprint,
* where numerous events are tracked through tasks and gameplay events.
*
* Some task graphs can become large as they start referencing numerous
* tasks and potentially assets.
* This is why it's heavily encouraged to only soft reference
* task graphs and use the AsyncActivateTaskGraphNode.
* By default, you can only create task graphs through this
* async function to prevent hard reference mistakes. */
